# Germany Ultrafast Lasers Market 2025 First-rate Statistics Associated with Key Vendors- Trumpf, Coherent,  Lumentum,  IPG Photonics

<strong>Ultrafast Lasers Market Snapshot 2025-2033 provides a concise overview of market trends, forecasts, and growth opportunities over the forecast period:</strong>

The Ultrafast lasers are increasingly used to perform micro-structuring in the automotive industry. One such technique is making an array of small pits on the surface of a part. These small pits hold oil because of the surface tension and prevent direct metal-to-metal contact, thus significantly reducing the friction between the moving parts. These ultrafast lasers are most useful for micro-structuring on parts that have an intricate shape, as it can be used to rapidly process even the most complex surface geometries. One example of this kind of micro-structuring is turbocharger turbine wheel shafts. These parts are subjected to large forces and rotate at high speeds. In order to reduce the friction, increase operating efficiency, and improve product life, ultrafast lasers can be used to produce small pits of size around 40-100 ?m in length and 10-20 ?m in width on the shafts.
